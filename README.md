  - select the desired venue location
  - create a post with your diet specific specifications
  - search for a post with similar tags to find out about where you're going to eat

eatWell is currently still under construction.

This project is designed to implement a standard Create - Read - Update - Destroy style database to front-end interaction.
AngularJS framework is the essential toolbase used for the front-end side and Firebase is the functional framework of the database.

If you're on Mac OS X, consider installing with [Homebrew](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv#homebrew-on-mac-os-x). Run the command ```$ python --version``` from your command line , we recommend Python 3.3.6

If you do not have pyenv use this [link](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv#homebrew-on-mac-os-x) to install.

This project was built using Python 3.3, click [here](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.3.0/) to install this version.

Once you have Python 3.3 installed you can pull down our code by using the following commands:
- ```$ git clone https://github.com/nss-day-cohort-13/language-analyzer-lazer-powered-cthulhu.git```
- ```$ cd language-analyzer-lazer-powered-cthulhu```

### Test the code
---
We implemented test driven development in this project. First we wrote a complete test suite for each of our modules. The test suite provided the framework and planning for the logic and implementation. Here is an example of passing tests used to assign values to the behvior predictor module.
